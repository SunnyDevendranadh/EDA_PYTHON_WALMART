```python
#average purchase per customer

avg_purchse_cust = df.groupby('Gender')['Purchase'].mean()
avg_purchse_cust_df = avg_purchse_cust.reset_index()
avg_purchse_cust_df.columns = ['Gender','Average Purchase Amount']

total_avg_purchase = avg_purchse_cust_df['Average Purchase Amount'].sum()

avg_purchse_cust_df['Percentage'] = avg_purchse_cust_df['Average Purchase Amount']/ total_avg_purchase *100

plt.figure(figsize=(9,10))
ax = sns.barplot(x='Gender',y='Average Purchase Amount',data=avg_purchse_cust_df,palette=walmart_palette)
ax.set_title('Average Purchase Amount by Gender')

- Higher Average Purchase by Males: Male customers have a higher average purchase amount, contributing 51.9% of the total, indicating they tend to spend more per transaction compared to female customers.
- Significant Contribution from Females: Female customers, while spending slightly less on average, still contribute a substantial 48.1% to the total purchase amount, underscoring their importance in the overall revenue.
- Close Spending Patterns Between Genders: The difference in average purchase amounts between male and female customers is relatively small, suggesting similar purchasing power and behavior across genders.
- Potential for Gender-Specific Marketing: The data suggests potential for targeted marketing campaigns that cater specifically to the spending habits of each gender, potentially boosting overall sales.
- Balanced Product Offering Strategy: Given the nearly equal contribution from both genders, itâ€™s important to maintain a balanced product offering that appeals to both male and female customers to maximize market reach.

The analysis of average purchase amounts by gender reveals important insights into customer behavior. By recognizing and catering to the slight differences in spending between male and female customers, the business can optimize its marketing and product strategies to increase overall sales and customer satisfaction.

#### 5. Occupation-Based Spending Analysis

```python
occupation_purchase_avg = df.groupby('Occupation')['Purchase'].mean()
occupation_purchase_avg_df = occupation_purchase_avg.reset_index()
occupation_purchase_avg_df.columns = ['Occupation', 'Average Purchase Amount']

plt.figure(figsize=(17, 12))
ax = sns.barplot(x='Occupation', y='Average Purchase Amount', data=occupation_purchase_avg_df, palette='rocket')

# Annotate each bar with the percentage
total = occupation_purchase_avg_df['Average Purchase Amount'].sum()
for p in ax.patches:
    percentage = f'{100 * p.get_height() / total:.1f}%'
    x = p.get_x() + p.get_width() / 2
    y = p.get_height()
    ax.annotate(percentage, (x, y), ha='center', va='bottom')

# Set plot title and labels
ax.set_title('Average Purchase Amount by Occupation')
ax.set_xlabel('Occupation')
ax.set_ylabel('Average Purchase Amount')

plt.show()
```
![alt text](image-6.png)

- Highest Average Purchase in Occupation 15: Occupation 15 has the highest average purchase amount, contributing 5.1% to the total, making it a key segment for targeting high-value customers.
- Multiple High-Spending Occupations: Occupations 12, 14, and 15 all contribute around 5% each, indicating several key occupations drive significant revenue.
- Consistent Spending Across Most Occupations: The majority of occupations contribute between 4.5% and 5.1% to the total, showing a relatively even distribution of spending across different job types.
- Lower, Yet Significant, Spending in Some Occupations: Occupations like 10 and 19 have slightly lower contributions (around 4.5%) but still represent important customer segments that shouldnâ€™t be overlooked.
- Need for a Balanced Marketing Strategy: The relatively narrow range in spending contributions suggests a need for a balanced marketing approach that effectively targets all occupations, ensuring broad appeal and maximized revenue.

The occupation-based purchase analysis reveals that while some occupations have higher average purchase amounts, the differences are not extreme. This suggests the need for a balanced marketing strategy that targets high-spending occupations while still addressing the needs of lower-spending ones to maximize overall business performance.

#### 6. Distribution of Purchases Across Demographics and Categories

The boxplots offer valuable insights into how different demographic and categorical factors influence purchasing behavior. By understanding these patterns, businesses can better tailor their marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer engagement efforts to align with the spending habits and preferences of various customer segments.


```python
df.boxplot("Purchase", by = "Occupation")
df.boxplot("Purchase", by = "Marital_Status")
df.boxplot("Purchase", by = "Product_Category")
df.boxplot("Purchase", by = "Stay_In_Current_City_Years")
df.boxplot("Purchase", by = "Gender")
```
![alt text](image-7.png)
1. Occupation-Based Purchase Distribution:
- Insight: The boxplot for occupation shows a relativ
ely wide range of purchase amounts across different occupations. However, certain occupations exhibit a higher number of outliers, indicating some customers in these groups tend to make significantly larger purchases.

- Implication: Occupations with more outliers or a higher median purchase value could be targeted for premium products or exclusive offers, as they may include higher-spending customers.

![alt text](image-8.png)
2. Marital Status Impact on Purchases:

- Insight: The boxplot comparing purchase amounts by marital status shows similar distributions between married (1) and unmarried (0) customers, with both groups having a comparable median purchase amount and a similar spread of outliers.

- Implication: Marketing strategies should equally target both married and unmarried customers, as their purchasing behaviors are not significantly different, ensuring inclusivity in promotional campaigns.

![alt text](image-9.png)

3. Product Category Purchase Patterns:

- Insight: The boxplot for product categories shows that certain categories have a much wider range of purchase amounts and more outliers, indicating that products in these categories are more likely to be higher-value or have more premium options.

- Implication: Focus on product categories with a broader range of purchase amounts for upselling and cross-selling opportunities, particularly those with higher median values and more outliers.

![alt text](image-10.png)

4. Impact of Stay in Current City:

- Insight: The boxplot analyzing the years spent in the current city shows consistent median purchase amounts across all categories, with similar spreads and outliers. This suggests that the length of stay in a city does not significantly impact purchase behavior.

- Implication: Customer retention efforts should not overly focus on the duration of residency, as it does not appear to influence spending patterns. Instead, marketing should be broad-based to appeal to all customers regardless of how long theyâ€™ve lived in the city.

![alt text](image-11.png)

5. Gender-Based Purchase Analysis:

- Insight: The gender-based boxplot reveals that while both genders show similar median purchase amounts, there are slightly more outliers in male customers, indicating a tendency among some males to make larger purchases.

- Implication: While marketing strategies should remain inclusive, consider creating targeted campaigns that cater to male customers who may be inclined towards higher spending, especially for premium products.

#### 7. Age Group Preferences in Product Categories Using Heatmap

```python
fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(12, 8))
cax = ax.matshow(age_product_freq, cmap='viridis')
fig.colorbar(cax)
ax.set_xticks(range(len(age_product_freq.columns)))
ax.set_xticklabels(age_product_freq.columns, rotation=90)
ax.set_yticks(range(len(age_product_freq.index)))
ax.set_yticklabels(age_product_freq.index)
ax.set_title('Product Purchases by Age Group', pad=20)
plt.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```
![alt text](image-12.png)

- 26-35 Age Group Dominates Purchases: The 26-35 age group shows the highest purchase frequency across several key product categories, making them the most active shoppers and a critical target for marketing efforts.

- Category-Specific Preferences by Age: Different age groups show distinct preferences for certain product categories, indicating the need for age-specific marketing strategies to maximize engagement and sales.

- Underperforming Product Categories: Some product categories (e.g., 16, 17, 19) have low purchase frequencies across all age groups, suggesting potential issues with product appeal or visibility that need addressing.

- Growth Opportunities in Moderately Popular Categories: Categories like 7, 10, and 13, which show moderate engagement across multiple age groups, represent opportunities for growth through targeted promotions and enhanced visibility.

- Need for a Balanced Marketing Approach: The spread of purchase activity across various age groups and categories suggests that a balanced marketing strategy is necessary to cater to diverse customer preferences and maximize overall sales.


## Recommendations Based on the Analysis

Based on the insights derived from the visualizations, here are targeted recommendations to optimize business strategies:

#### Targeted Marketing Strategies
-  Focus on the 26-35 Age Group: This group is the most active in terms of purchases across multiple product categories. Tailor marketing campaigns and promotions specifically for this age segment, emphasizing products that align with their preferences.

- 	Age-Specific Product Recommendations: Utilize the distinct preferences of different age groups to craft personalized product recommendations. For instance, promote tech gadgets to younger segments and household items or wellness products to older segments.

#### Product and Pricing Strategy

- Leverage Popular Price Points: Capitalize on the key price points identified in the purchase amount distribution (around 5,000, 10,000, and 15,000). Consider offering bundled products or promotions at these price levels to increase average transaction values.

- Revise Product Strategies for Underperforming Categories: Reevaluate the product mix in categories with lower engagement, such as categories 16, 17, and 19. Consider discontinuing low-performing items or introducing new products that align better with customer needs.

#### Enhanced Customer Engagement

- Develop Occupation-Specific Campaigns: Occupations like 15, 12, and 14 exhibit higher spending patterns. Design exclusive offers or loyalty programs targeting these high-value occupations to maximize customer lifetime value.
- Gender-Inclusive Promotions: While spending is relatively balanced between genders, create campaigns that resonate with both male and female customers, ensuring that product selections and marketing messages appeal broadly.

#### Product Portfolio Optimization
- Expand Offerings in High-Growth Categories: Focus on product categories that show growth potential across multiple age groups, such as categories 7, 10, and 13. Increase the visibility of these products through targeted advertising and promotions.

- Enhance Visibility of Niche Products: For product categories with fewer purchases, but with identified niche markets, explore opportunities to boost their visibility through targeted marketing, strategic placement in stores, or featuring them in online marketplaces.

Balanced Resource Allocation 
- Allocate Marketing Budgets Based on Customer Segments: Allocate marketing resources proportionally based on the contribution of different age groups and occupations to the overall revenue. This ensures that high-value segments receive the attention needed to maximize returns.

- Use Insights for Strategic Planning: Incorporate the data-driven insights into broader strategic planning, ensuring that product development, inventory management, and customer relationship management (CRM) are aligned with the preferences and behaviors identified in the analysis.
